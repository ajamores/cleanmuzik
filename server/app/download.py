"""Download stage — YouTube song → tagged bestaudio in staging (R1, T-004).

The first stage of the pipeline (spec §4). Two jobs:

1. `reject_playlist_url` / `is_playlist_url` — a **pure**, network-free classifier
   that says whether a URL is a playlist (many songs) or a single song. R1 takes
   exactly one song per run (spec §2/§3); a playlist is refused here, and T-012
   turns this same signal into the `POST /api/jobs` 422 (spec §6/§7).
2. `download_song` — pull **bestaudio** for one song URL into a staging dir with
   `--embed-metadata`, so the file carries the video's title/artist tags. A bare
   `-x` rip strips tags → beets runs an empty MusicBrainz query → HTTP 400
   (learnings). We do **not** transcode to MP3 here — that is T-005 / ADR-002.
   This stage only lands a tagged bestaudio file and returns its path for T-005.

Staging cleanup on failure is T-012's job; this module only creates the dir.

# have to be recognised — see `_names_one_song`.

# What it does NOT do is refuse a song merely for carrying a `list=`. YouTube
# appends `&list=RD…` on its own when you play from Liked Videos or a search

# names exactly one song. Refusing those blocked the primary flow outright
# (first browser session, 2026-07-18) while protecting nothing: `download_song`
# passes `noplaylist=True`, so yt-dlp fetches the single named song regardless.
