# R1 Architectural Decision Records — CleanMuzik

Binding decisions. Short bullets, not a formal ledger. The reviewer checks new code against
these; anything that violates one gets sent back. They exist to stop a later session (a future
agent, or the owner himself) from silently undoing a decision and reintroducing the problem it
prevented.

Format: `ADR-NNN — decision. Rationale. [date]`

> ADR-001–005 mirror the PRD's hard constraints — they exist as a reviewer checklist. From
> **ADR-006 onward**, this file records decisions *born in the build* that the PRD doesn't
> already contain (e.g. the beets `choose_match` seam, the numeric `strong_rec_thresh` value,
> native-vs-Docker Jellyfin, the watched-folder path). Those are the ones that actually earn
> their keep — a future agent could otherwise silently reverse them.

- **ADR-001 — Processing is sequential, one track at a time, with a delay between requests.
  Do not parallelize the pipeline.** Rationale: avoids rate limits on identification/download.
  (from PRD hard constraints) [2026-07-11]

- **ADR-002 — Output is MP3 320, and only MP3 320.** Rationale: YouTube source is ~128–160 kbps;
  MP3 320 preserves it transparently. No other output formats without a stated reason.

- **ADR-003 — One track failing must not stop the batch.** Rationale: surface a per-track error
  event and continue. (from PRD) [2026-07-11]

- **ADR-004 — Single-user, no in-app auth.** Rationale: security is handled at the network layer
  (Tailscale), not in the app. (from PRD) [2026-07-11]

- **ADR-005 — beets is the tagging engine; never reintroduce a bespoke ShazamIO/Mutagen tagger.**
  Rationale: plugins (chroma, lastgenre, fetchart, embedart) are more capable and maintained.
